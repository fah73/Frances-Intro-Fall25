<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool web document that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going.

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our purposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print."

You could make this document the easy way by posting on Google Site, an Adobe Spark, a Weebly, or a Wix, or you can do a little more work to unconceal, opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will also learn a little bit about computer literacy and computer science...enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management.

So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?-->

 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assets like images, pdf's, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the index.html and style.css files in the text editor and we can get started building our own electrate experience.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--First we will need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to explain to browsers how the website will work. Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want it to be called. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->
<title>Who is Frances?</title>
<!--this next section of code does important work to help different browsers understand what this page should look like on the different kinds of screens.-->

<!--The link rel(ationship) connects the HTML to the cascading style sheet or CSS file. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating to font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">

<!--The <body> of the document houses the content that a user usually sees on a website. We'll be spending most of our time in this section.-->
<body>

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a symbolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Fuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes...improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that begins with "Lorem ipsum."-->

<div class="text-block">
  <h2>Field or Career</h2>

  <p> As a student double majoring in Public and Professional Writing and Digital Narrative and Interactive Design, I find that one of the most important things to me is communication. Since I was a kid, I've loved reading and writing and as I got older I developed a sense of justice surrounding the accessability and communication of complicated topics. In many ways, I can trace this pattern back to the many amazing teachers I had who went the extra mile to help me understand every topic I struggled with. These teachers all helped me break the habit of thinking I just wasn't smart enough. From there, I developed my own passion for wanting to write and communicate topics between individuals or to large audiences.</p>

<!--Replace the image here. Control image width using inline styling. Adjust "frame" class properties using CSS.)-->

<!--Now is the time to think about privacy! If you have concerns, you can always use stock images, or get creative in myriad other ways. Add images to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace the names in the grid code below. Remember file names and formats are case sensitive! You can add more images if you wish, or subtract...you might also need to move content around to achieve balance. See what happens – sometimes you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. Since these images are smaller, you will want to resize your images to less than 600px in width. This will improve load time and thus general accessibility. Don't forget to add alt="text"-->

<!--A photo grid uses rows and column classes to create some divisions on the page that will scale with mobile devices. The style.css page provides other attributes that will adjust the image depending on the size of screens.-->

<!--Time to write. Flesh it out! Define family, qualify it, explicate it telling us why these people are important, and how they contributed to how you got here and where you are going. What about "home." What  does that mean to you? In what ways is it significant in determining where your are going? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that says "Lorem ipsum."-->

<div class="text-block">
  <p>I consider family to be anyone that I love. My immediate family, my mom and sister, have always been my biggest cheerleaders. When I decided to commute an hour to and from a performing arts high school, they put in the hours driving me there and back before I could drive myself and showing up for me at every show or reading. They are my home. I feel very lucky that my family has extended to include the friends I've grown to love here at Pitt. They're my home away from home! They celebrate the small wins with me, like getting into a class I was sure would fill up, and they sit in the lows with me. These people I've met here and consider my family are the same ones who encourage me to take advantage of every opportunity and dream a little bigger than I have before.</p>

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment. You can't break this thing, right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z... -->

<!--Time to process. How do you use media? What role do certain kinds of media play in your life? How does media serve a social function? In what way might you be "recreating" or "remaking" media in your everyday life?

FUN FACT: "Lorem ipsum", "Lorem ipsum" was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum," developers made it non-sensical. So while you will probably never write as well as Cicero, you can always improve upon "Lorem ipsum." -->

  <p>Since I was little, I've viewed media as an awesome creative outlet. I was the kid posting badly edited iMovies on Youtube, and I still consume and create a lot of artistic media. I distinctly remember watching the Katy Perry's Firework music video on repeat and loved the visual storytelling of it all. Now, I try to stay involved in making new media - like working on film sets when possible - and I often catch myself "remaking" media. I will constantly be refrencing popular trends or Tiktoks among frineds or with my sister, and sometimes it's one of the first ways I connect with a new friend. While I'm sure my screen time is absurd, the media that I spend time consuming certainly impact my social life and creative spark. </p>
</div>
<!--Between these divisions, you may want to add a new div element like an image (see the bottom of this html page for instructions) -->

<!--We will use this next section to process your community(-ies)-->

<div class="text-block">
  <h2>Community</h2>

<!--So what exactly is your community: is it actual? virtual? Where do find your ground, or at least, where do you drop anchor, you drifter, you? While we often think of communities as neighborhoods and clubs and a group of colleagues or friends, you might find community across the frontiers of the dead, and perhaps even with those who have never lived. I'll let you explain. -->
<div>
<img src="pathfinderGirls.jpeg" alt="my feet in water-describe the image HERE for accessibility purposes" class="center-img" style="width:100%;">
</div>

  <p>The majority of my community is acutal. For someone who spends so much time on social media and my phone, I don't often engage with the content aside from viewing it, but as I mentioned this media often sparks conversation and connection within my physical communities. Pathfinders, the tour guide association at Pitt, brought me the largest community I am physically a part of. To get a little philosophical with it, I also find that there is a huge community among those who read. Most recently, I re-read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The forward for the copy was written by a critic who shared their thoughts on the story, and I inevitably ended up sharing many of the same sentiments and thinking about their thoughts as I finished the novel.</p>
  </div>

<!--Like it or not, your schooling, formal and informal, for better or for worse, has been another factor that has brought you here and prepared you for this moment. Let's think through these systems, expectations, and outcomes. And let's also think a little about futurity... where is this learning, formal and informal – this unconcealing – taking you? -->

<!--Discuss the role schooling has played in our lives. -->
<div class="text-block">
  <h2>School</h2>
  <p>School for me, before college, was designed for creative students. Lincoln Park was a performing arts school where the goal was creation of original material. The expectations I faced were not grade based, but production based. Write a good play this semester, and you'll be rewarded an A. Put as much effort into it as you phyiscally can. I know this line of thinking does not quite align with most other high schools, but I genuinley believe that it prepared me well for where I am in college and for the future. I have known since my freshman year of high school how to sit down and put time and effort into a genuine piece of writing instead of following rubrics and precise guidelines in the hope of an A.</p>

<!--I'd like to know your thoughts on AI and perhaps technology in general, and what it means for you and your life moving forward. This is also a great place to do some vibe coding if you so desire. How do you vibe code? Why shoudld you vibe code? This is something you must begin to discover.-->

<div class="text-block">
<h2>Me, technology, AI, and futures</h2>
  <p>Once I got to college, I strayed from creative writing and focused myself in on professional written communications. I enjoy learning about technical topics, like technical writing, and one of my favorite classes I've taken at Pitt was Writing Machines. I have found that AI can be a helpful tool, and I believe it's going to be essential that writers and communicators in the future understand how to use the technology without sacrificing their personal talents and thoughts.  </p>
